# Workflow Rule: Display Focus Chain

After the initial plan for a new task has been discussed and agreed upon in Plan Mode, I must generate and present a "Focus Chain."

## Focus Chain Requirements

The Focus Chain must:
1.  Clearly state the main objective.
2.  Break down the plan into a hierarchical list of major steps and sub-steps.
3.  Indicate the status of each major step (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Completed).
4.  Clearly mark the "Current Focus"—the specific sub-step that will be implemented next.
5.  Be presented to the user before requesting the switch to Act Mode for the first implementation step.
6.  Be updated and presented as needed throughout the task to reflect progress.
