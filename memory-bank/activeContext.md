# Active Context

## Current Focus
Core Feature Development: Building the User Interface.

## Next Steps
1.  **Component Scaffolding:** Create the basic, static UI components for the chat interface (e.g., `ChatInput`, `MessageList`, `ChatMessage`).
2.  **TDD for UI:** Write a failing E2E test that verifies a user can type a message into the input, click a "Send" button, and see their message appear in the message list.
3.  **State Management:** Implement simple client-side state management (e.g., using `useState`) to handle the chat history and make the E2E test pass.
