# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project's foundational documentation and version control are now in place. The next immediate goal is to initialize the Next.js application and its core tooling, setting the stage for our Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow.

## Next Steps
1.  **Initialize Next.js Project:** Create the Next.js application which will serve as the foundation for all subsequent tooling.
2.  **Install Core Dependencies:** Add all necessary libraries, including Playwright for testing and crawling.
3.  **Configure Playwright for E2E Testing:** Run the Playwright init command to add its specific configuration (`playwright.config.ts`) and test directory structure to the project.
4.  **Begin TDD Cycle:** Write the first failing E2E test with Playwright, which will verify that the homepage loads and displays a title.
