# Active Context

## Current Focus
The immediate goal is to set up the foundational structure of the Next.js project. This includes initializing the application, establishing the basic file and folder structure, and installing the core dependencies.

## Next Steps
1.  Initialize a new Next.js project.
2.  Install primary dependencies: Tailwind CSS, Playwright, LangChain.js, Supabase client, Vercel AI SDK, and the Replicate client.
3.  Configure Tailwind CSS.
4.  Set up environment variables (`.env.local`) for storing configuration secrets and parameters.
