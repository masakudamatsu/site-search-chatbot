# Product Context

## Core Purpose
This project is a proof-of-concept to build a chatbot that provides a natural language search experience for a specific website. Unlike traditional keyword search, it allows users to ask questions in full sentences and receive answers in a conversational format, with citations linking back to the source webpages.

## Problem Solved
For content-heavy websites, traditional search bars can be inefficient. Users often have to guess the right keywords and sift through a list of links. This chatbot aims to provide a more intuitive, "NotebookLM-like" experience, where users can interact with a website's content as if they were having a conversation with a knowledgeable assistant.

## User Experience Goals
- **Conversational Search:** Users should feel like they are having a natural conversation, not just typing keywords.
- **Accurate, Cited Answers:** Responses must be grounded in the website's content and provide clear links to the source pages.
- **Contextual Follow-ups:** The chatbot should be able to understand and respond to follow-up questions, maintaining the context of the ongoing conversation.
